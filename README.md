This is a responsive Spotify Clone built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It mimics the core features of Spotify, including a sleek music player, play/pause controls, song list, current playback time, and dynamic UI. Users can browse available songs, play/pause music, and interact with a simple yet attractive interface. The app uses locally stored music files and JavaScript logic to simulate playback. Itâ€™s designed for educational purposes and frontend practice. Future updates may include playlists, volume control, and backend integration. Compatible with all modern browsers and responsive across devices.
